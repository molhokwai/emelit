And then I began this sonetto, that which begins: A ciascun´alma presa e gentil core. There were replies from many to this sonnet and of differing interpretation: among those who replied was one whom I call the foremost of my friends, and he wrote then a sonnet, that which begins: ‘Vedeste, al mio parere, onne valore: You saw, it seems to me, every worth.’…. And this was virtually the beginning of the friendship between him and myself, when he knew that it was I who had made the request of him. The true meaning of that dream was not then seen by anyone, but now it is clear to the most unknowing.’</em>

                You’ll find a tender woman there,

            <p>
                Of an intellect so sweet,

                That it will be delight complete
            </p>
            <p>
                For you to leave her never.

                And then, my soul, adore her,

                Worthy as she is, for ever.

                Like a veil of light – born of that shadow

                Which is of Mars – that arrives and remains;

                He is created – has sensation – name,

                From the soul, manner – from the heart, will.<span class="floatright">20</span>

                As in the subject – location and dwelling.

            <p>
                Shines out – of himself perpetual impression;

                That will itself – ’stead of reason – is valid:

                Poor in discernment – so vice is his friend.

                Thus runs counter to what brings succour:

                Not that he is by nature in conflict;

                But twisted awry from true perfection

                By fate – no man possessor of life can say<span class="floatright">40</span>

                That once established – he has no lordship.

            <p>
                Likewise he has power though men forget.

                That a further measure – of nature’s – at play;

            <p>
                Then he will never adorn himself – with rest.<span class="floatright">45</span>

            <p>
                Moving – changing colour, laughing through tears,
            </p>
            <p>
                Contorting – the features – with signatures of fear;

            <p>
                Scarce pausing; – yet you will note of him

            <p>
                He’s most often found with people of worth.
            </p>
            <p>
                His strange quality gives rise to sighing,<span class="floatright">50</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                And makes a man gaze – into formless places

            <p>
                Arousing the passion that stirs a flame,

            <p>
                (No man can imagine him who’s not known him)

            <p>
                Unmoving – yet he draws all towards him,
            </p>
            <p>
                Not turning about – to discover joy:<span class="floatright">55</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor minded to know whether great or small.
            </p>
            <p>
                From his like he elicits – the complex glance
            </p>
            <p>
                That makes – the pleasure – appear more certain:
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor can stay hidden – when he is met with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not savage indeed – yet beauty his arrow,<span class="floatright">60</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                So that desire – for fear is – made skilful:
            </p>
            <p>
                Following all merit – in the piercing spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor can be comprehended from the face:
            </p>
            <p>
                Seen – as blankness fallen among objects;
            </p>
            <p>
                Listening deep – yet seeing not form itself:<span class="floatright">65</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                But led by what emanates from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Far from colour, of separate being,
            </p>
            <p>
                Seated – in midst of darkness, skirting the light,
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet far from all deceit – I say, worthy of trust,
            </p>
            <p>
                So that compassion is born from him alone.<span class="floatright">70</span>

                <strong>Note</strong>: <em>Donna me prega expresses a view of Love, Amore, as a darkness born of Mars (17-18) not of Venus, which enters the intellect (21-28), displaces reason, and directs the will towards its likeness (57-66) a process which threatens a fatal (35) confusion. Noble spirits are stirred by it since it has virtues (69-70) but it tends to obscure the light of the intellect (36-56) and twist it awry. The challenge to reason is overcome only by self-control, and love’s delights have no ideal meaning. Dante took a fundamentally different position, where love is positive and progressive from physical to intellectual to spiritual realms. Guido’s characterisation of Love (64-68) forms a powerful image, and I would relate Guido to Marlowe and Shelley in his possible atheism, his proud individualistic character, and his political involvement, but above all in this sense of the dark chaotic forces which stem from passion, and can initiate the war of the head and the heart.</em>
